Description: Kernel driver for SPI-based TPMs
 The tpm-tis-spi driver allows the kernel TPM subsystem to work with
 TPMs via an SPI interface.  It is part of the mainline kernel, but
 is not included in Debian Stretch. Further, the version in the
 4.9 kernel is buggy. The version in this package includes backports
 of fixes that first appeared in 4.12 kernel.
 .
